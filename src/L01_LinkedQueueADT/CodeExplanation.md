In object-oriented programming (OOP), it's a common practice to define an interface before creating a class that 
implements it.

An interface defines a contract or a set of methods that a class must implement. By defining an interface first, you can:

1. Clearly define the required methods and their signatures.
2. Ensure that any class that implements the interface provides the necessary functionality.
3. Decouple the interface from the implementation, making it easier to change or replace the implementation without affecting other parts of the code.

In the case of the `LinkedQueueADT` class, the `AbstractLinkedQueue` interface is likely defined elsewhere in the codebase, and the `LinkedQueueADT` class is implementing that interface.

If you didn't have an existing interface, you could create the `LinkedQueueADT` class without an interface, and it would still work. However, by using an interface, you're following good OOP practices and making your code more maintainable and flexible.

Let's break down the code into smaller sections and go through each part step by step.

**Section 1: Class Definition and Constructor**

```java
public class LinkedQueueADT<E> implements AbstractLinkedQueue<E> {
    private Node head;
    private Node tail;
    private int size;

    // constructor
    public LinkedQueueADT (){
        this.head = null;
        this.tail = null;
        this.size = 0;
    }
```

* This defines a class called `LinkedQueueADT` that implements the `AbstractLinkedQueue` interface.
* The class has three instance variables: `head`, `tail`, and `size`, which are used to keep track of the queue's state.
* The constructor initializes the `head` and `tail` variables to `null` and sets the `size` to 0.

**Section 2: Adding Elements to the Queue**

```java
@Override
public void offer ( E element ) {
    // makes a new node
    Node newNode = new Node( element );

    // if queue is empty
    if (this.head == null && this.tail == null){
        // set both head and tail to new node
        this.head = newNode;
        this.tail = newNode;
    } else { // if queue is not empty
        // set the next of the tail to the new node
        this.tail.next = newNode;
        // set the tail to the new node
        this.tail = newNode;
    }

    this.size++;
}
```

* This method adds an element to the end of the queue.
* It creates a new `Node` object with the given element.
* If the queue is empty, it sets both the `head` and `tail` variables to the new node.
* If the queue is not empty, it sets the `next` variable of the current `tail` node to the new node and updates the `tail` variable to point to the new node.
* Finally, it increments the `size` variable.

**Section 3: Removing Elements from the Queue**

```java
@Override
public E poll() {
    if (this.head == null && this.tail == null) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("The queue is empty.");
    }

    E oldElement = this.head.element;

    if (this.head == this.tail) {
        this.head = null;
        this.tail = null;
    } else {
        Node tempNode = this.head;
        this.head = this.head.next;
        tempNode.next = null;
    }

    this.size--;

    return oldElement;
}
```

* This method removes and returns the element at the front of the queue.
* If the queue is empty, it throws an `IllegalStateException`.
* It stores the element to be removed in the `oldElement` variable.
* If the queue has only one element, it sets both the `head` and `tail` variables to `null`.
* If the queue has more than one element, it updates the `head` variable to point to the next node and sets the `next` variable of the current `head` node to `null`.
* Finally, it decrements the `size` variable and returns the removed element.

**Section 4: Other Methods**

The code also includes other methods such as `peek()`, `size()`, `isEmpty()`, and `toString()`, which are used to inspect the queue's state.

* `peek()` returns the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
* `size()` returns the number of elements in the queue.
* `isEmpty()` returns a boolean indicating whether the queue is empty.
* `toString()` returns a string representation of the queue.

**Section 5: Node Class**

```java
private class Node {
    // data
    private E element;
    private Node next;

    // constructor
    public Node ( E element ) {
        this.element = element;
        this.next = null;
    }
}
```

* This defines a private inner class called `Node` that represents an individual element in the linked list.
* Each `Node` object has two instance variables: `element` and `next`, which are used to store the element's value and a reference to the next node in the list.

**Section 6: LinkedQueueADTRunner Class**

```java
class LinkedQueueADTRunner {
    public static void main ( String[] args ) {
        // Create a new instance of LinkedQueueADT
        LinkedQueueADT<Integer> myQueue = new LinkedQueueADT<>();

        // Is the queue empty? : true
        System.out.println(myQueue.isEmpty());

        // What happens when we try to poll an empty queue?
        // It must throw an IllegalStateException in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalStateException: The queue is empty.
        // System.out.println(myQueue.poll());

        // Add elements to the queue
